# Configure Security Operations using Microsoft Sentinel

## Objective

The "Configure SIEM for Security Operations Using Microsoft Sentinel" lab focuses on equipping me with the practical skills needed to configure and manage a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Microsoft Sentinel. This lab covers key aspects of security operations, including the setup, configuration, and optimization of Sentinel for monitoring and responding to security threats. I will also learn how to create and manage workbooks, analytics rules, incidents, and automation playbooks, enabling them to effectively leverage Sentinel for enhancing organizational security posture.


### Skills Learned

- Azure administration
- Configuring Microsoft Sentinel for security monitoring
- Creating and managing workbooks for data visualization
- Setting up and tuning analytics rules for threat detection
- Designing and implementing automation playbooks for efficient operations

### Tools Used

- Azure
- Microsoft Sentinel
- 

### Prerequisites 
Azure Subscription

## Steps
Following Microsoft policy I cannot share the detailed steps and screenshots of what I did to complete the lab. But all updated steps to complete this lab can be found on [MS Learn - Configure SIEM security operations using Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/applied-skills/configure-siem-security-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/). Completing this lab I earned the [applied skills certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/credentials/share/en-gb/JaedynDamms-1608/E40E566641FAFAA9?sharingId=592CAF5B8FD33BDB).

### Step 1 - [Configure SIEM operations using Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/configure-siem-security-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/2-exercise)
- Create Azure Log Analytics workspace
- Deploy Microsoft Sentinel to the workspace


### Step 2 - [Install Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub solutions and data connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/configure-siem-security-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/3-exercise)
Configure Microsoft Sentinel to ingest data using Microsoft Sentinel solutions
- Install connectors via Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub


### Step 3 - [Configure a data connector Data Collection Rule](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/configure-siem-security-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/4-exercise)
- Configure data connector rule to collect security events
- Detect threats using near real time analytic rules
- Configure automation in Microsoft Sentinel to create an incident and assign incident to operator


### Step 4 - [Perform a simulated attack to validate the Analytic and Automation rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/modules/configure-siem-security-operations-using-microsoft-sentinel/5-exercise)
Perform privilege escalatioin attack to validate analytic and automation rules.
